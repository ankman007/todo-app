# Project Description

This repo contains backend for a FastAPI-based Todo application is supported by a PostgreSQL database. It provides endpoints for managing Todo items, including `add_todo` to create new tasks, `delete_todo` to remove tasks by ID, `update_todo` to modify existing tasks, `get_todo` to retrieve a specific task, and `get_todos` to fetch all tasks in the list. 

The applicationâ€™s main entry point is the main.py file located in the root directory. Additionally, the project also has dedicated files within the app directory for models, views, and schemas, promoting a clean and organized code structure.
